# Mr. Manager

Generic process monitor/manager, has a cool format that isn't documented yet because I'm kind of lazy.

# Running

Any of the following will work to run the command:

```
mr-manager
mr-man
mrm
```

## Options

* `-c` - config file location, if not specified looks for `mrm.toml` or `mrm.yaml` in the `cwd`
